# Genetic Algorithm vs simulated Annealing 

# NQueen Game
 use local search algorithms to solve n-Queen problems. Implement 
both 1) Simulated Annealing and 2.) Genetic Algorithm to solve the 
n-queen problem where 
n=21 generate a large number of n-queen instances (>500) and solve 
them. Measure the percentage of solved
 problems search costs and the average running time. Explain why 
you get such results, for example, why
 the algorithm can only solve the percentage of the problems that 
it did.
